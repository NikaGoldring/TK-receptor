%% BYOM function derivatives.m (the model in ODEs)
%
%  Syntax: dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)
%
% This function calculates the derivatives for the model system. It is
% linked to the script files for Calanus2016, fit body residues with
% two-compartment TK. As input, it gets:
%
% * _t_   is the time point, provided by the ODE solver
% * _X_   is a vector with the previous value of the states
% * _par_ is the parameter structure
% * _c_   is the external concentration (or scenario number)
% * _glo_ is the structure with information (normally global)
%
% Time _t_ and scenario name _c_ are handed over as single numbers by
% <call_deri.html call_deri.m> (you do not have to use them in this
% function). Output _dX_ (as vector) provides the differentials for each
% state at _t_.

%% Start

function dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)

%% Unpack states
% The state variables enter this function in the vector _X_. Here, we give
% them a more handy name.

Ci   = X(1); % state 1 (internal concentrations) at previous time point
N_RL = X(2); % state 2 (receptor-agonist complex concentration) at previous time point

% these concentrations are both expressed on volume basis.

%% Unpack parameters
% The parameters enter this function in the structure _par_. The names in
% the structure are the same as those defined in the byom script file.
% The 1 between parentheses is needed as each parameter has 5 associated
% values.

FMS = glo.FMS;  % normalize for membrane protein content assuming a density of 1 (VMP/VS)

ke    = par.ke(1);    % elimination rate constant, d-1
ku    = par.ku(1);    % uptake rate constant, L/kg/d
kon   = par.kon(1);   % association of ligand-receptor complex
%koff  = par.koff(1);  % dissociation of ligand-receptor complex
B_MAX = par.B_MAX(1); % maximal binding capacity, Âµmol/kg 
Kd = par.Kd(1);       % equilibrium dissociation constant, nmol 

%% Extract correct exposure for THIS time point
% Allow for external concentrations to change over time, either
% continuously, or in steps, or as a static renewal with first-order
% disappearance. For constant exposure, the code in this section is skipped
% (and could also be removed).

if glo.timevar(1) == 1 % if we are warned that we have a time-varying concentration ...
    c = read_scen(-1,c,t,glo); % use read_scen to derive actual exposure concentration
    % Note: this has glo as input to the function to save time!
    % the -1 lets read_scen know we are calling from derivatives (so need one c)
end

%% Calculate the derivatives
% This is the actual model, specified as a system of two ODEs:

% Calculating the change of ligand concentration in membrane protein
% fraction with either (1) the Michaelis-Menten kinetics or (2) the second
% order kinetics. 
if glo.R_mod == 1 
    dN_RL =  B_MAX * ( Ci / (Kd + Ci) ) ; % Michaelis-Menten kinetics 
elseif glo.R_mod == 2
    dN_RL =  kon * Ci * max(0, (B_MAX - N_RL)) ; % second order kinetics
else 
    print('Define a receptor kinetic (R_mod)')
    return
end

% Calculating the change of the ligand concentration in the structure
% compartment.
dCi = ku * c - ke * Ci - dN_RL * FMS; % first order bioconcentration

%Calculating the change of the total ligand concentration in the organism.
dC_tot = dCi + dN_RL * FMS; 

dX = [dCi;dN_RL;dC_tot]; % collect all derivatives in one vector dX,
